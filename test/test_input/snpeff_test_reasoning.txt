These 4 cases can all club together because there will be an expressed mutation, and 2 non
expressed stop-inducing mutations for the rna-based run, and cases with stop before and after for
the non-rna run to see if the correct IARs will be called.
1. Expressed mutation
2. Non Expressed mutation
3. Chained mutation with a stop codon as first mutation. (This can be unexpressed so the chaining
   will be displayed in the non-rna run)
4. Chained mutation with a stop codon as second mutation. (This can be unexpressed so the chaining
   will be displayed in the non-rna run)

5. Non expressed mutation in a region with <=5 ref reads

These 3 will form 2 possible chains in the non-rna run, and one possible chain in the rna one
6. Mutation in a non-expressed exon (splice variant)

5. Chained mutations
