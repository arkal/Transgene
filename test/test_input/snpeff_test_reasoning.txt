These 4 cases can all club together because there will be an expressed mutation, and 2 non
expressed stop-inducing mutations for the rna-based run, and cases with stop before and after for
the non-rna run to see if the correct IARs will be called.
1. Expressed mutation
2. Non Expressed mutation
3. Chained mutation with a stop codon as first mutation. (This can be unexpressed so the chaining
   will be displayed in the non-rna run)
4. Chained mutation with a stop codon as second mutation. (This can be unexpressed so the chaining
   will be displayed in the non-rna run)

5. Non expressed mutation in a region with <=5 ref reads. This is an OxoG mutant (<1% ALT)
chr6    31670475        .       G       T       .       PASS    ENST00000440843.3:S>Y

These 3 will form 2 possible chains in the non-rna run, and one possible chain in the rna one.
6. Mutation in a non-expressed exon (splice variant)

7. Chained mutations
7a. Incidentally, , Also an MNP where only one of the two alleles is expressed in the RNA.
chr6    31669898        .       A       G       .       PASS    ENST00000492084.1:L>P,ENST00000395952.3:Y>H

8. This mutation is not expressed but it contains an "n+1 error in the position called by
snpeff" and will come up in the non-rna run.
chr6    31842572        .       A       G       .       PASS    ENST00000229729.10:F>L

9. This mutation has 2 REF read support in the RNA with many spanning reads but is an OxoG mutant in the exome (All Forward read)
chr6    31939912        .       C       A       .       PASS    ENST00000375331.2:Q>K
